# Dynamic Logging

Steeltoe adds a Logging provider to the set of available logging packages to support the Steeltoe management logger endpoint.

When used with the Steeltoe management logger endpoint, this package enables dynamically changing the logging levels for running applications with the [Pivotal Apps Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-0/console/index.html) on Cloud Foundry.
