## Spring One Workshops - GModernizing .NET Applications with VMware Tanzu Application Service

In this session we will take an existing .NET Framework application that is working perfectly fine in IIS, as an api serving up restful endpoints, and we will publish to Tanzu Application Services for Windows. Along the way we will use Steeltoe to modernize things a bit, as well create a cf manifest for deployment.

>[!TIP]
> As you make your way through the labs the idea is to place your IDE and the lab steps side-by-side. Before continuing with the workshop go ahead and open your preferred IDE by clicking either the purple Visual Studio icon or the blue VS Code icon in the task bar.

With Visual Studio as your IDE
